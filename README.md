## Order Pad Architecture
An order pad has mainly three components, `Category`, `Allergen`, and `Item`. A `category` is different section of a menu such as **appetizers**, **entr√©es**, **desserts**, and **drinks**. Each `category` consists of `items` that fall under the same category. For example, a category, `"appetizers"`, can possibly contain items like **french fries**, **nachos**, **guacamole**, and **spinach dips**. An `allergen` is an ingredient that an `item` contain that can possibly be an allergen to a customer. You can create a list of allergens and select them when you create an item when the allergens are included in the item.

## Usage

When you access the main page of the website there are two main routes you can access, which are `management` and `server`. Simply put, in the `management` route you can create and modify an order pad for your business, and a server at your business can download the order pad from `sever` route and use it.
