Online order pad that does everything a paper order pad does paperlessly in an intutively designed user interface and more things that only a digital solution can offer. A business owner can create a customized order pad for the business and the servers can download the order pad to their mobile device simply through an unique id of the order pad. With `Infinite Order`, you don't need to squeeze your writtings into a small pocket-size paper and don't need to flip through pages to keep a track of each table and get confused. 

Take the full control over your table management and deliver a perfect dining service!
