Online order pad that does everything a paper order pad does paperlessly in an intutively designed user interface and more things that only a digital solution can offer. A business owner can create a customized order pad for the business and the servers can download the order pad to their mobile device simply through an unique id of the order pad. With `Infinite Order`, you don't need to squeeze your writtings into a small pocket-size paper and don't need to flip through pages to keep a track of each table and get confused. 

Take the full control over your table management and deliver a perfect dining service!

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
